          <h2>Finding Zeros</h2>
          <p>In order to find the zeros of an equation:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Set the equation equal to 0</li>
            <li>Factor if possible, or use the quadratic formula</li>
            <li>Plug in x and find the value of x that makes the equation equal to 0</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Let's look at an example:</p>
          <img src="example.PNG">
          <p>In this case, you would factor by grouping, where you put parentheses around the first two terms and the last two terms:</p>
          <img src="1.PNG">
          <p>Then you would factor out an x<sup>2</sup> on the left and a -9 on the right:</p>
          <img src="2.PNG">
          <p>Notice how the experssions in the parentheses are the same? That means we can distribute that expression out because the x<sup>2</sup> and -9 are being multiplied by that expression:</p>
          <img src="3.PNG">
          <p>The second expression is fine now. Notice how the first expression is a difference of squares (If you need help with that, look back at your polynomial identities)? That means we can factor that out even more:</p>
          <img src="4.PNG">
          <p>Now we can set each of these expressions to 0 to find the zeros of the original equation:</p>

          <h2>Graphing the Equation</h2>
          <p>Now that you have the zeros, you need to know how the graph will look like.</p>
          <p>Since the leading coefficient of the original equation is 2x<sup>3</sup>, the endpoints will look like y=x.</p>
          <p>Using that information, you can start filling in the graph:</p>

          <p>Hopefully this helps for now, because there's a lot more to this.</p>
