    <h1>Conjugate Root Theorem</h1>
    <p>The Conjugate Root Theorem states that if a polynomial function has a root of a + sqrt(b), then another root is a - sqrt(b).</p>
    <p>It also says that if a root is a + bi, then a - bi is a root.</p>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>If 3i is the root of a polynomial function, then -3i is another root.</p>
    <p>If 7 - sqrt(2) is a root of a polynomial, then 7 + sqrt(2) is another root.
    <h2>Writing Polynomial Functions Using the Conjugate Root Theorem</h2>
    <p>When given a root that is in the for a +- sqrt(b) or a +- bi, you can find the other root, set those roots as factors, and multiply them to get your original function.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <img src="Pictures/7.PNG">
    <p>Because it's a quadratic equation, it has 2 roots. 2 + 5i is a root, so 2 - 5i is the other root.</p>
    <p>That means x = 2 + 5i and x = 2 - 5i.</p>
    <p>Now you must move the root to the other side to make it a factor:</p>
    <p>x - 2 - 5i = 0 and x - 2 + 5i = 0</p>
    <p>Now that you have your factors, you can multiply them together to get your original equation:</p>
    <p>(x - 2 - 5i)(x - 2 + 5i)</p>
    <p>x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 5ix - 2x + 4 - 10i - 5ix + 10i -25i<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 4 + 25</p>
    <p>x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 29</p>
    <p>Your original polynomial would be x<sup>2</sup> - 4x + 29</p>
