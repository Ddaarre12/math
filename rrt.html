    <h1>Rational Root Theorem</h1>
    <p>The Rational Root Theorem states that the possible roots of polynomial function is in the form p/q, where p is the factors of the constant, and q is the factors of the leading coefficient.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <img src="Pictures/8.PNG">
    <p>Because the constant is -8 and the leading coefficient is 4, the factors of -8 will be the numerator and the factors of 4 will be the denominator</p>
    <p>-8: 1, 2, 4, 8</p>
    <p>4: 1, 2, 4</p>
    <p>The possible roots of the polynomial is:</p>
    <p>1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8</p>
    <p>(All of these could be positive or negative)</p>
    <p>If you want to find the actual roots, you'd have to plug in the possible roots</p>
    <h2>Using the Rational Root Theorem</h2>
    <img src="Pictures/9.PNG">
    <p>Because v(x) should equal 28, you need to subtract 28 to the other side to get:</p>
    <p>4x<sup>3</sup> - 10x<sup>2</sup> - 6x - 28 = 0</p>
    <p>Now you can use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible roots for the function</p>
    <p>-28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28</p>
    <p>4: 1, 2, 4</p>
    <p>Now you need to plug in each possible root to find the actual root.</p>
    <p>(You should only use positive factors in this case because we are dealing with measurements)</p>
    <p>After plugging in possible roots, you should find that 7/2 is a root. That means x = 7/2.</p>
    <p>In the question, they are asking for the height, which is x inches.</p>
    <p>Therefore, if x inches is the height and x = 7/2, then the height is 7/2 inches.</p>
